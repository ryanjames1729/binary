# binary

When teaching students binary numbers, we often use a copy of a 'Flippy-Do' where students can flip the paper to reveal the binary numbers to add or subtract to help with converting binary numbers to decimal or vice versa.

This is an online version of the same thing. Students can click on a 'bit' to turn it on and off. Then they can check their work by allowing the site to calculate the decimal or binary number for them.
